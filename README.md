# TERRAIN-RECOGNITION-AND-CLASSIFICATION-USING-DEEPLEARNING
Terrain Recognition and Classification using Vision Transformers A Vision Transformer-based system achieving 97% accuracy for terrain classification. Features custom architecture, Flask web app for image uploads and inference, and robust pre-processing with TensorFlow Hub. The model first recognizes the terrain features in the image and then classifies them into predefined categories.


This repository contains an advanced terrain classification system utilizing Vision Transformers, designed for applications in military, navigation, and agriculture.
